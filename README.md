# Walmart Sales Analysis and Predictive Modeling
## Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of historical sales data from Walmart, including details on weekly sales, the impact of holidays, customer price index, unemployment rate, etc. This project aims to understand the correlation between Walmart sales and different factors and leverage predict modeling to predict sales, evaluating the impact of other factors and providing insights to develop strategies for minimizing costs and maximizing economic impact. 

## Technology Used
- Programming language: Python
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlit.pylot
  - Sklearn

## Approach
1. Data Preprocessing
- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis (i.e., converting data formats and creating new columns)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Plot the visualization of the features to understand the data trends
- Create a heatmap to visualize correlation matrix to examine the relationship between sales data and different variables
- Plot histograms of the features to understand the distributions

3. Clustering
- Use K-Means clustering to segment stores based on sales data

4. Machine Learning
- Implement regression models to predict sales and identify key features that influence sales performance
